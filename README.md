# python3_client_server
Simple client/server for UNIX/Linus written in Python 3

This was originally a simple client/server written in Perl that I used in my UNIX Systems Administration and Perl classes.

I have converted it to Python 3.

The purpose of this code was two-fold.  Originally intended for my UNIX Systems Administration and Advanced UNIX Systems
Administration classes to show how to create a "well behaved" daemon and to discuss client/server protocols.  I used the 
original code in my Perl class to show the skeleton of a working client/server system written in Perl.
